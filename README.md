# CLONE-Flappy-Bird-Game

This is a clone of the simple game, Flappy bird, which is no longer available.

This program was written in C# and visually designed with XAML. This is a simple showcase of key-bindings, boundary-checking, and basic physics (gravity).

Simply tap or hold the spacebar to make the bird "fly", and try to guide it through the incoming pipes.
